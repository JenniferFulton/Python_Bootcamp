# The BankAccount class should have a balance. When a new BankAccount instance is created, if an amount is given, the balance of the account should initially be set to that amount; otherwise, the balance should start at $0. The account should also have an interest rate, saved as a decimal (i.e. 1% would be saved as 0.01), which should be provided upon instantiation. (Hint: when using default values in parameters, the order of parameters matters!)

# The class should also have the following methods:

# deposit(self, amount) - increases the account balance by the given amount
# withdraw(self, amount) - decreases the account balance by the given amount if there are sufficient funds; if there is not enough money, print a message "Insufficient funds: Charging a $5 fee" and deduct $5
# display_account_info(self) - print to the console: eg. "Balance: $100"
# yield_interest(self) - increases the account balance by the current balance * the interest rate (as long as the balance is positive)


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance, interest_rate):
        self.balance = balance
        self.interest_rate = interest_rate
